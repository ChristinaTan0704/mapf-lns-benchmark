## Introduction
TODO: will be updated by June 25th, 2024

## Installation

The code requires external libraries 
BOOST (https://www.boost.org/) and Eigen (https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/). 
An easy way to install the required libraries on Ubuntu:    
```shell script
sudo apt update
```
- Install the Eigen library (used for linear algebra computing)
 ```shell script
    sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
 ```
- Install the boost library 
 ```shell script
    sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
 ```
